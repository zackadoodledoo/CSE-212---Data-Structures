# Data Structures Tutorial
## I. Welcome
* Introduction: This tutorial will provide an overview of key data structures, focusing on their usage, efficiency, and 
* practical problem-solving applications.

## II. Stack 
* 
* Introduction: 
* A stack is a linear data structure that follows 
* a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, meaning the last added 
* item is the first to be removed. It's used in situations 
* where you need to reverse items or backtrack, like in undo  
* mechanisms.
* 
* Basic Operations: Push (adding an element), Pop (removing the 
* top element), Peek (viewing the top element without removing it)
* 
* 
* Understanding Stack Overflow and Underflow: Explanation of capacity limits and error conditions when attempting to pop 
* from an empty stack or push to a full one.
* 
* Applications of Stacks: Examples include syntax parsing, recursive algorithms, and expression evaluation in compilers.
* 
* Efficiency of common operations: All operations (push, pop, peek) have O(1) time complexity.
* 
* Example Problem: Implement a stack to reverse a string.
* 
* Problem to Solve: Use a stack to validate balanced parentheses in an expression.
* 
## III. Linked List 
* Introduction: 
* A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each pointing to the next node 
* in the sequence. It's useful for dynamic memory allocation.
* 
* Types of Linked Lists: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists
* 
* Operations on Linked Lists: Insertion, deletion, search, and traversal through the list
* 
* Advantages and Disadvantages: Compared to arrays, they allow easier insertion and deletion but have slower access times.
* 
* 
* 
* Efficiency of Common Operations: Insertion and deletion can be O(1) if the position is known; searching is O(n).
* 
* Example Problem: 
* Implement a function to reverse a linked list.
* 
* Problem to Solve: 
* Create a linked list to store and display in reverse order.
* 
## IV. Tree
* Introduction: Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root element and sub-elements, branching out to represent data
* in a parent-child relationship. Useful for naturally hierarchical data.
* 
* Types of Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, B-trees
* 
* Tree Traversal Methods: Pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order traversals
* 
*  Applications of Trees: Organizing hierarchical data like file systems, databases for quick search operations, syntax 
* trees in compilers
* 
* Efficiency of common operations
* In a balanced binary search tree, search, insertion, and deletion have a time complexity of O(log n).
* 
* 
* Example Problem:
* Implement an in-order traversal of a binary tree.
* 
* 
* Problem to Solve: 
* Construct a binary search tree from a set of numbers and perform a search operation to find a specific value.
